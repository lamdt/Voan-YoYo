The Live Chat facility serves to host live discussions between community members to not only directly communicate with friends, store owners, developers, and service providers around the world, but also to quickly receive and provide support in urgent matters.<br />
<br />
The tight integration with the support forum opens the Live Chat facility to over 250,000 registered community members ready to participate in live chat sessions.<br />
<br />
In addition to our <a href="http://www.oscommerce.com/partners/corporate,info">Corporate Sponsorship</a> program, commercial developers and service providers now have an additional channel to reach out directly to community members seeking direct and professional support with their online stores. One-On-One discussions can be held in private chat rooms to discuss potential deals.<br />
<br />
The Live Chat facility will also be used to host official events to discuss our future goals and receive direct feedback from our users. Our first events will occur with the next releases we push out and for our upcoming bug hunting days that will soon be announced.<br />
<br />
We‘re excited to provide this new channel in communicating even closer to our users and look forward to the discussions being held. The Live Chat facility is available on our Community Support forum at:<br />

This can be confirmed if after the upgrade CoreUpdate still shows v3.0.1 is available to upgrade to. This is due to incorrectly detecting certain file permissions and has been fixed in v3.0.1. We apologize if this affects you and direct you to the manual v3.0 to v3.0.1 upgrade package that can be extracted and copied over to your installation.</p><p>We've taken this opportunity and have greatly improved CoreUpdate to now perform non-destructive updates.
